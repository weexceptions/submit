       <p style="font-size: medium"> Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium. Calcium is one of the main building blocks of bone. A lack of vitamin D can lead to bone diseases such as osteoporosis or rickets. Vitamin D also has a role in your nerve, muscle, and immune systems.
<br>You can get vitamin D in three ways: through your skin, from your diet, and from supplements. Your body forms vitamin D naturally after exposure to sunlight. However, too much sun exposure can lead to skin aging and skin cancer. So many people try to get their vitamin D from other sources.
Vitamin D-rich foods include egg yolks, saltwater fish, and liver. Some other foods, like milk and cereal, often have added vitamin D.<br><br>
The amount of vitamin D you need each day depends on your age. The recommended amounts, in international units (IU), are<br><br>
•	Birth to 12 months: 400 IU<br>
•	Children 1-13 years: 600 IU<br>
•	Teens 14-18 years: 600 IU<br>
•	Adults 19-70 years: 600 IU<br>
•	Adults 71 years and older: 800 IU<br>
•	Pregnant and breastfeeding women: 600 IU<br>
People at high risk of vitamin D deficiency may need more
